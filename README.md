# Comparative-study-of-path-algorithms-in-graphs

The purpose of this project was to determinate which is the best algorithm for determining the fastest path in a graph and illustrate how each algorithm explores the graph. To test the algorithms I used a graph that was arrange in a maze structure. The algorithms tested were Dijkstra, A*, Greedy BFS, Depth First, Bread First. From this project I've learned how to make Java graphics with swing.
